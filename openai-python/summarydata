Summarize this text please :    Weather data flow through neural nets and populate massive data centers, but they also reside in refrigerators and polystyrene tubes. And the climate archive (like most archives) gets wilder and dirtier the deeper you go. To survey the past 150 years or so, climate researchers can use instrument readings from ships and weather stations, but to understand global patterns across deep time, they must turn to proxies: ice cores, boreholes, lake and ocean sediments, pollens, tree rings, corals, stalactites and stalagmites, and other natural features that index climatic events. 1 The geologic field itself, and strategically selected samples of it, become archival documents, in the same way that, for Suzanne Briet, “the photographs and the catalogues of stars, the stones in a museum of mineralogy, and the animals that are catalogued and shown in a zoo” are documents. 2 Yet those data and documents are not structured uniformly. Species collections, core samples, and medieval manuscripts can all help researchers understand the changing climate, but they are subject to widely varying protocols of collection, preservation, and access. Some state geologic surveys house their rocks in “museums,” while others maintain “sample libraries,” “reference collections,” or “repositories.” Differences in terminology reflect different conventions of thought and practice.
