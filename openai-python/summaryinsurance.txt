OkoshiSan Would like to hear KosakiSanâ€™s voice on these topics so that we can explore

KosakiSan :

Did he explain structure of Insurance org and where we are going?

My teams goal is General Insurance and Insurance Agency, in JP insurance is siloed and unfriendly

Since Gen Insurance recently, it is easier to offer insurance with Travel and other products

So we do insurance debut from Gen Insurance, then move to high LTV products like General Insurance

In terms of data, its important to capture right data and meaning, whether doing shopping or travel, right product at right time, understand life stage to do cross sell and upsell to life insurance

Sunil :  Is this done offline or online

KosakiSan : We are trying to embed as part of exisitn product. For ex. in travel do travel insurance as part of travel flow we want to do with other entities

Platform for 1to1 marketing for all members, but we want to get data of members, by analyzing we can create logic we can identify which person needs which insurance right now and do the marketing within Rakuten Insurance Group. Thats what we are doing right now

KosakiSan : Any information for Call Center, we are trying to establish a next generation call center. It is going to be relesed some time in February. I am not familiar if your team is involved in this

Core System development is not only for Call Center but also for Insurance product, its very old and separate and we are trying to integrate for One Cloud
